# Privacy Policy for Medium Helper

**Last Updated:** 22 Jan 2026

## Introduction

Medium Helper ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The Medium Helper extension:
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track your browsing behavior
- Does not store any data locally or remotely
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not require user accounts or registration

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely on your device:
- It detects limited articles on Medium.com
- It fetches article content from publicly available sources (freedium-mirror.cfd)
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to our servers (we don't operate any servers)

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- **Host permissions for medium.com**: Required to detect and interact with Medium articles
- **Host permissions for freedium-mirror.cfd**: Required to fetch article content from the mirror service

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not involve data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the extension's version and this document.
